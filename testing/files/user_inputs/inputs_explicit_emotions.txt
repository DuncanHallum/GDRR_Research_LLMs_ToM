Hi, I’m feeling really frustrated. A colleague presented work that I spent a lot of time on, and they didn’t acknowledge my role in it at all. I’m upset, but I also don’t want to come across as petty. What’s the best way to bring this up?#
I’m honestly feeling pretty overwhelmed. My manager constantly checks in on every detail of what I’m doing, and it’s starting to make me doubt myself. I don’t want to be disrespectful, but I need more breathing room.
I’m starting to feel worn down. A teammate keeps making these passive-aggressive comments when we’re working together, and while they act like it’s nothing, it’s getting under my skin. How do I call this out without making things worse?
I’m annoyed and a bit resentful. I’m working on a joint project, and I’ve done almost everything while my colleague barely shows up. I don’t want to create tension, but I can’t keep picking up the slack.
I’m feeling disrespected. A coworker frequently talks over me or dismisses what I say in meetings, and it’s chipping away at my confidence. How do I assert myself without causing conflict?
I feel really uncomfortable. A coworker makes jokes that cross the line, but they always laugh it off like it’s nothing. I’m not sure how to say something without it becoming a big deal, but I can’t keep pretending it’s okay.
I’m getting really frustrated. I’m supposed to be collaborating with someone who barely responds to messages or updates me on progress, and it’s slowing everything down. How do I bring this up directly but professionally?
I’m feeling hurt and confused. I recently got promoted, and someone I was close with at work has been acting cold and distant since then. I don’t want to lose that connection, but I don’t know how to fix this.
I’m feeling drained. There’s someone on my team who constantly positions themselves for recognition—even when the work was shared. I’m tired of being sidelined but don’t want to come off as bitter.
I’m frustrated and honestly a little anxious. My project partner has a chaotic, last-minute approach that clashes completely with my structured style. It’s causing a lot of stress. How can I address this without creating more tension?
