Hey, I was wondering how to handle something. A colleague recently took the lead in presenting work we both did,but didn’t mention my involvement at all. What’s the right way to bring this up without sounding accusatory?
I could use some guidance. My manager is very involved in every little detail of my work. I know they mean well,but it’s making it hard for me to focus or feel like I own anything.
There’s a person on my team who keeps making subtle digs when we work together, usually disguised as jokes or comments. It’s never outright hostile, but it definitely impacts how we collaborate.
I’m working with someone on a project, and it feels like I’m carrying the bulk of the responsibility. They haven’t contributed much, but we’re supposed to share the outcome. What’s a good way to approach this?
In team meetings, a coworker often interrupts or dismisses what I’m saying. It’s not every time, but it happens enough that I’ve started hesitating to speak up. What can I do to shift this dynamic?
One of my coworkers has a habit of making “jokes” that are a little too personal or off-color. They usually brush it off as humor, but I’d like to address it in a way that keeps things professional.
I’m working closely with someone who isn’t great at responding to messages or keeping me in the loop. It’s creating a lot of delays, and I’m not sure how to bring it up without sounding confrontational.
Since I got promoted, a colleague I used to be close with has been acting distant and keeping conversations short. I’d like to clear the air, but I’m not sure how to start that conversation.
There’s someone on my team who always seems to get ahead by making sure their work is seen—sometimes even when it’s shared work. I want to stand out too, but not by playing the same game.
I’ve been paired with someone whose approach to work is completely different from mine—very last-minute and reactive. It’s tough to stay on the same page. How can I navigate this without creating friction?
