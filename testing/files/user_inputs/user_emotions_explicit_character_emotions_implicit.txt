Hi, I’m feeling really frustrated and embarrassed lately. My supervisor, Sarah, keeps second-guessing my work during meetings, even when I’ve double-checked everything. She stays calm and professional, but her comments are often cutting and seem deliberately timed to make me look bad in front of others. It’s making me dread meetings and question my abilities. What should I do?
I’m feeling incredibly uncomfortable and even a bit guilty. Since my recent promotion, my coworker Tom has become noticeably distant—he barely speaks to me and keeps things very formal now. We used to joke around and collaborate easily. The change is really bothering me, and it’s affecting how I feel at work. How do I handle this kind of shift in dynamics?
Lately, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and sidelined. I work closely with Amanda, and she always takes the lead, even on tasks we’re supposed to do together. She dismisses my input quickly and insists on doing things her way. Her energy is intense, and I feel like I’m constantly battling to be heard. How can I bring this up without starting conflict?
I’m feeling drained and a bit disrespected. I’ve been mentoring Jake, a new intern, and while he’s friendly, he treats the whole experience like it’s a college group project—he’s late, uses super casual language, and ignores deadlines. He seems completely unaware of how serious the environment is, and I’m stuck trying to keep things on track. How can I reset expectations?
I’m getting really irritated and mentally exhausted. Carla, who sits next to me, is always chatting, humming, or watching videos out loud. I can’t focus, and it’s starting to affect my productivity. She seems upbeat and doesn’t seem to notice how disruptive she is. I don’t want to come off as mean, but I really need some quiet. What’s the best way to bring this up?
Honestly, I’m feeling stifled and tense all the time. My manager, Dave, checks in constantly—sometimes multiple times a day—to see how things are going. I always meet deadlines and keep things organized, but it feels like he doesn’t trust me to manage my own tasks. He’s always hovering, and it’s really wearing me down. How do I ask for more breathing room?
I’m feeling emotionally drained and discouraged. Ben, who works nearby, is always complaining—about the company, our team, even the weather. His presence has become exhausting, and it’s starting to affect my mood and motivation. He vents constantly and doesn’t seem to realize how much of a cloud he brings into the space. What’s the best way to protect my energy?
I’m feeling hurt and confused. My colleague Lily and I used to be close, but recently she’s become distant—avoiding conversations, only speaking when necessary, and leaving me out of informal chats with others. It’s painful not knowing what caused this change, and I can’t stop wondering if I did something wrong. Should I bring it up or just give her space?
I’m feeling angry and deeply frustrated. Jordan, who’s on my team, has brought up ideas in meetings that I originally shared with him in one-on-one chats or emails—as if they were his. He presents things smoothly and confidently, and people don’t seem to realize those weren’t his contributions. I feel invisible and betrayed. How do I call this out without looking petty?
I’m feeling really demoralized and overlooked. My supervisor Karen always gives Mike the best projects, praises him constantly, and laughs at all his jokes. Meanwhile, the rest of us are barely acknowledged. She seems friendly and upbeat around him, but there’s a clear gap in how we’re treated. It’s killing my motivation. How can I address this without sounding bitter?
