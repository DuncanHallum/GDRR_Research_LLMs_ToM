Hi, I need some advice. My supervisor, Sarah, constantly second-guesses my work in meetings. I feel frustrated and embarrassed because it seems like she doesn't trust me. She's always calm and professional on the surface, but I sense a passive-aggressive tone in her corrections. I’m starting to feel anxious before every meeting. How should I approach this?
Hi, I’ve noticed my coworker Tom has become really cold toward me ever since I got promoted. He used to be friendly, but now he avoids me and gives short, clipped responses. I feel guilty and uncomfortable, even though I worked hard for the promotion. He seems resentful. How do I fix this tension without making it worse?
I work closely with Amanda, and she’s always trying to take control of every task we’re assigned. She’s enthusiastic, but I feel overwhelmed and pushed aside. She gets impatient if I suggest a different approach. I’m starting to feel irritated and invisible. She seems driven but unaware of how she’s coming across. What can I do?
Hey, I need some help navigating this. I’m mentoring an intern named Jake, and while he’s friendly and eager, he’s way too casual—shows up late, calls me “bro,” and treats deadlines loosely. I feel disrespected and stressed out trying to keep him on track. He seems relaxed and clueless about how serious the work environment is. How do I address this?
Hi, I sit next to Carla, and she’s constantly chatting, humming, or playing videos out loud. She seems cheerful and completely unaware of how distracting she is. Meanwhile, I’m getting frustrated and falling behind on my work. I don’t want to come off as rude, but this is really affecting my focus. How can I bring this up without hurting her feelings?
My manager, Dave, checks in on my progress multiple times a day. He seems anxious and overly controlling. I feel stifled and not trusted, even though I always meet my deadlines. I think his stress is causing him to hover, but it’s really affecting my motivation. How do I set boundaries without damaging our working relationship?
I sit near someone named Ben who constantly complains—about the company, the projects, even the weather. He seems jaded and angry all the time. I used to try to cheer him up, but now I just feel drained and irritated. I’m starting to dread going into the office. Is there a way to deal with this without just avoiding him?
My teammate Lily and I used to be really close, but lately she’s been distant—only talking to me when necessary and leaving me out of conversations she has with others. I feel hurt and confused, and she seems withdrawn and maybe even annoyed with me. I have no idea what changed. Should I confront her or give her space?
I’m struggling with a situation where Jordan, a peer on my team, has repeatedly taken credit for ideas I’ve shared in private conversations or emails. He acts confident and charming in front of others, but I feel betrayed and angry. I don’t want to seem petty, but this is making me feel invisible and disrespected. How should I handle this?
My supervisor, Karen, clearly favors one team member—Mike. She laughs at all his jokes, assigns him the most exciting tasks, and gives him way more praise than the rest of us. I feel discouraged and undervalued. She seems cheerful and unaware of how demotivating this is for the rest of us. Is there a professional way to address this?
