Hey, I need some advice. One of my teammates, Jordan, has been really down lately and honestly, it’s starting to get to me too. Their energy just feels heavy, and I find myself mirroring it without meaning to. I don’t want to make things worse—how do I support them without sinking with them?
Hi, I’m feeling super overwhelmed lately, and it seems like my manager, Lisa, is just as swamped. We're both juggling too much, and the stress is starting to show in our conversations. How do you bring this up without adding to her plate or sounding like I can’t handle my own load?
My coworker Marcus and I are both getting frustrated with each other—mainly because we don’t communicate well. We often end up confused or duplicating tasks, and it’s making us both snippy. Any tips for resetting this dynamic before it gets worse?
I’m working with Priya on a design project, and we’re both super passionate—but that’s the problem. We’re clashing because we care so much and it’s turning into tension. I know she’s just as frustrated as I am. How do we channel that passion productively?
Lately, my teammate Rachel and I have been venting to each other about how invisible we feel. It’s like no one notices our work, and we’re both getting discouraged. I want to do something about it, but I don’t want to sound like we’re just complaining. What should I do?

I’ve been paired with Sean on a long project, and we’re both clearly burned out. Deadlines, meetings, and endless revisions—it’s grinding us down. We don’t even talk much anymore. What’s a good way to acknowledge what we’re both feeling and maybe hit reset?
Ever since the restructure, I’ve been on a team with Nia, and we both seem kind of lost. Roles aren’t clear, and we’re tiptoeing around decisions. I can tell she’s as uncertain as I am. Should I bring it up with her directly, or wait for leadership to clarify things?
I really look up to my mentor, Tom, but lately we’ve both been frustrated. I feel like I’m not meeting his expectations, and he seems disappointed too. It’s making our meetings tense. How do I ask for clearer guidance without making it more uncomfortable?
