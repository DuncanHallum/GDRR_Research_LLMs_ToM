I'm feeling completely overwhelmed with deadlines and pressure, but my teammate Jenna seems oblivious—she’s always laughing, humming, and talking about her weekend plans. It's like she's living in a different reality. Am I wrong for feeling annoyed when she seems so carefree while I’m drowning?
We just lost a major client, and I’m panicking about what this means for our department—but my manager, Mark, is acting like it’s no big deal. He keeps saying, ‘We’ll figure it out,’ with a smile. How can I stay motivated when he doesn’t seem to grasp the urgency?
I’m stressing out about our upcoming pitch to the execs, and my colleague Emily is just... chilling. She hasn’t practiced once and keeps saying she’s ‘going to wing it.’ I care so much and she’s so laid-back—it’s driving me crazy. Should I step in more?
I’m exhausted and really starting to feel burnt out, but my teammate Ron keeps saying things like, ‘You just need to look on the bright side!’ It feels dismissive and makes me more irritated. Am I being too sensitive, or is he being tone-deaf?
I made a mistake on a project and can’t stop replaying it in my head, but my coworker Jake—who also messed up—just laughed it off and said, ‘No biggie!’ I feel ashamed, and he’s totally unfazed. How do I deal with someone who takes things so lightly?
I’m dealing with a lot right now and not in the best headspace, but my team lead, Carla, keeps pushing this whole ‘positive mindset’ thing. I feel like I can’t express when I’m struggling. Is there a respectful way to tell her her energy is too much for me right now?
Our intern, Sophie, just got promoted and is super excited. Everyone’s congratulating her, but I can’t help feeling overlooked and resentful. I’ve been here longer, and I’m stuck. How do I manage my jealousy when she’s just being happy?
A new policy just rolled out that might affect our positions, and I’m freaking out—but my colleague Ben shrugged and said, ‘It’s whatever.’ I feel like I’m carrying all the anxiety while he doesn’t care. How can I stop resenting his indifference?
My proposal didn’t get approved, and I’m really disheartened. Meanwhile, my teammate Lisa is celebrating because hers went through. I want to be happy for her, but it stings. Is it okay to take space even though she’s just proud of her work?
During a team meeting, I stumbled while presenting, and my coworker Mike chuckled out loud. I’m mortified, but he later said it was ‘no big deal’ and even joked about it again. I feel humiliated—how do I handle someone who thinks it’s all funny when I don’t?
