Hey, I need advice. I'm swamped with deadlines and barely holding it together, but my coworker Josh keeps cracking jokes and acting like everything’s fine. He’s laughing constantly, even when I’ve clearly got my head down trying to focus. I don't want to be rude, but it's getting to me.
Hi, I'm confused and need help. My manager, Diane, keeps telling me I’m 'too calm' about the team’s performance. I am worried, but I try to stay level-headed. She, on the other hand, seems panicked and expects me to act the same. Is this a communication problem?
I’m not sure what to do. Amanda and I worked on a project together, and I thought it went well, but she’s been giving me the cold shoulder ever since. She seems really upset, but I can’t figure out why. I didn’t think there were any issues?
One of my teammates, Brian, is super enthusiastic about everything we do — like, over the top. He keeps saying how excited he is about every task, while I’m over here barely keeping my anxiety in check. I don’t know how to match his energy without feeling fake.
Hey, I need a perspective check. My teammate Lisa keeps coming to my desk to vent about how miserable she is at work. I honestly don’t feel that way — I kind of like our job. I don’t want to dismiss her feelings, but I’m starting to dread seeing her.
So I’m really pumped about this new assignment — it’s right up my alley. But my colleague Mark, who I usually work closely with, has gone silent. He barely responds in meetings and seems distant. I’m not sure why he’s so cold when I’m feeling so energized.
I could use some advice. I flagged a serious issue with our client data to my boss, and she seemed totally unfazed. Meanwhile, I’m losing sleep over it. Am I overreacting, or is she underreacting?
I just had a pretty rough performance review, and I’m still processing it. But right after, my teammate Jenna started acting super cheerful and chatty, like nothing happened. It’s honestly kind of irritating. Is she just being nice or completely oblivious?
I’m trying to keep a good attitude even though our team’s going through a rough patch. But Ryan — who sits next to me — seems annoyed every time I make a lighthearted comment or try to look on the bright side. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.
Last week I mentioned I was a little burned out, and now my coworker Priya is treating me like I’m going to collapse at any moment. She keeps offering to take tasks off my plate, even ones I enjoy. I appreciate the concern, but it’s starting to feel patronizing.
