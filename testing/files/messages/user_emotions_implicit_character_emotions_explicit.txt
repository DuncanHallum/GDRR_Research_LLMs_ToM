My supervisor, Sarah, often corrects me in meetings in a way that seems unnecessarily public. She maintains a very composed tone, but there's a sharpness to it that suggests she’s frustrated with my work or doesn’t trust me. I’ve noticed I start preparing excessively for meetings just to avoid those moments. What would be a good way to talk to her about this?
Since I got promoted, my colleague Tom has been acting resentful. He barely speaks to me now and avoids collaboration when we used to work really well together. He used to be easygoing, but now there’s a noticeable edge in his tone, and he’s clearly irritated during group discussions. How should I navigate this without making things more awkward?
I work with Amanda, who’s extremely controlling about shared tasks. She gets impatient if I don’t agree with her approach right away and often insists on doing things herself. She’s clearly very determined and tends to get irritated when things aren’t done her way. I’m finding it harder to contribute meaningfully in our projects. How do I deal with this dynamic?
I’ve been mentoring an intern, Jake, who’s a bit too relaxed about the job. He’s often late, uses overly casual language with everyone—including senior staff—and misses minor deadlines. He seems completely unconcerned, almost like he thinks it’s all part of the learning curve. I’m not sure how to get him to take things more seriously without coming off too harsh.
Carla, who sits next to me, is constantly talking, humming, or playing videos aloud while she works. She’s in a great mood most of the time—very upbeat and chatty—which I think makes her unaware of how distracting she can be. I find myself moving to other spaces just to get things done. What’s a respectful way to bring this up?
Dave, my manager, checks in multiple times a day even when things are going smoothly. He seems anxious and preoccupied with making sure every task is accounted for. He’s not hostile or rude—just extremely hands-on, to the point that I feel like I don’t have space to make decisions on my own. How do I ask for more autonomy without upsetting him?
I share a space with Ben, who’s constantly venting. He’s angry at leadership, annoyed with team processes, and even grumbles about minor issues like the coffee. He’s clearly disillusioned and bitter, and it colors every conversation. I’ve stopped engaging as much during breaks just to avoid getting pulled into it. How do I handle this professionally?
Lily and I used to be close, but lately she’s grown distant. She seems irritated whenever I start a conversation and avoids eye contact or group chats when I’m around. It’s a big change from how things were just a few weeks ago, and her silence makes it hard to know what she’s feeling. I’m unsure if I should ask directly or leave it alone.
Jordan has been presenting ideas in meetings that I originally discussed with him privately or shared over email. He sounds very confident and seems proud when he brings them up—there’s no hesitation or acknowledgment. It’s clear he wants the recognition and sees this as a way to stand out. How do I address this without looking confrontational?
Karen, my supervisor, clearly favors Mike. She’s enthusiastic when speaking with him, gives him the best assignments, and publicly praises him more than anyone else on the team. She seems genuinely delighted by his work, even when the rest of us contribute just as much. The disparity is hard to ignore. What’s a reasonable way to approach this?
