During meetings, my supervisor Sarah frequently comments on my work in front of others, often questioning small details I thought were resolved. Even when I’ve done my prep, she’ll bring up points that cast doubt on the quality of my work. These moments have become a regular pattern, and I’m trying to understand the best way to address it professionally.
Since I was promoted, Tom has been keeping his interactions with me brief and professional. We used to talk more casually and collaborate closely, but lately he sticks to work-only conversations and rarely joins group discussions when I’m present. The shift in our dynamic has been noticeable, and I’m not sure how to move forward.
Amanda and I are assigned to a number of joint projects. She often takes the lead without checking in and tends to move ahead with decisions before we’ve discussed things fully. When I offer suggestions, they’re often quickly dismissed or set aside. It’s made it hard for me to contribute the way I’d like to. I’m looking for advice on how to handle this constructively.
I’ve been mentoring an intern, Jake, who often shows up late, speaks to everyone informally, and isn’t always consistent with meeting small deadlines. I’ve tried giving him guidance, but things haven’t really changed. I’m looking for ways to help him adjust to the expectations of the workplace without making things uncomfortable.
Carla, who sits nearby, regularly plays videos out loud, hums, and starts casual conversations throughout the day. It’s a lively environment when she’s around, but I’ve found myself seeking quieter spots to work. I’m trying to find a respectful way to bring this up that doesn’t create tension.
My manager, Dave, checks in multiple times a day and frequently asks for updates on tasks that haven’t changed since the previous check-in. Even with a track record of completing work on time, I find myself being closely monitored. I’m not sure how to raise this in a way that leads to more independence while maintaining trust.
I work near Ben, who often makes negative comments about the company, coworkers, and general day-to-day issues. These conversations happen regularly, and they tend to shift the tone of the room. I’ve started spending more time at my desk and avoiding communal areas. I’d appreciate suggestions for navigating this without creating conflict.
Lily and I used to talk often, both about work and things outside of it. Over the past couple of weeks, she’s been more distant—keeping conversations short and rarely making time to chat. She often leaves me out of group interactions that we used to participate in together. I’m unsure whether to bring it up or let it play out.
On a few occasions, Jordan has shared ideas in meetings that were first discussed privately between us or that I outlined in team emails. He presents them confidently, and there’s usually no mention of our prior conversations. It’s been difficult to know how to respond in the moment. What’s the best way to handle this without escalating things?
Karen often gives Mike the more visible and strategic assignments and publicly recognizes his contributions in meetings. He’s regularly included in early planning stages that the rest of us only hear about later. The pattern has been consistent, and it’s starting to affect how our team works together. I’m considering whether it’s worth raising this or not.
